SCRIPT : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BxB-HUB/BxB-Hub-PremiumScript/main/BxB-Script/Open-AI/Example.lua

how to use:
- create an account in https://openai.com/api/
- go to Manage Account -> API Key (https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys), copy the api key and paste it inside the SECRET_KEY variable
- write the name of people you want the bot to reply to, inside the WHITELISTED table (or simply enable the CLOSE_RANGE_ONLY variable if you want it to answer everyone around you)
- enjoy

notes:
- the bot will only reply to texts that has > 15 characters and < 50 characters (you can change these settings in the script, inside the MESSAGE_SETTINGS table)
- there's a cooldown between replies in order to not spam the API, 5 seconds
- if the response is > 200 characters (roblox chat limit) then the text will be cut in 2 parts
